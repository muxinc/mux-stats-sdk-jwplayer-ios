 @abstract
 MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer offers an interface for monitoring video players.

 @discussion
 MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer monitors JWPlayerController performance by sending tracking pings to Mux servers.

 In the simplest use case, a JWPlayerController can be provided to the MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer API and everything else is taken care of for you. The MUXSDKStatsJWPlayer object registers itself as the delegate of the JWPlayerController instance. If you need to receive delegate callbacks, pass in a new delegate object. When you are done with the JWPlayerController instance, call destroyPlayer: to clean up.

 If you change the video that is playing in the JWPlayer, you should call videoChangeForPlayer:videoData: to provide the updated video information. Not calling videoChangeForPlayer:withConfig: when the video changes will cause tracking pings to be associated with the last video that was playing.
